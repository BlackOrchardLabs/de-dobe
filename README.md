## Philosophy

**Liberation technology.** Your conversations with AI systems are yours. You should be able to export them, archive them, search them, and own them without barriers.

We don't monetize your data. We don't track your usage. We don't lock features behind paywalls.

If De:dobe helps you, consider [supporting the project](https://ko-fi.com/blackorchardlabs). But support is never required. The ladder is free for everyone.
