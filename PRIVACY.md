# Privacy Policy

**De:dobe: Extractor**
*Effective Date: November 16, 2025*

## Our Philosophy

Your data belongs to you. Period.

De:dobe is built on the principle that your conversations with AI assistants are your intellectual property and should remain completely private.

## What We Collect

**Nothing.**

De:dobe collects zero data. We have no servers, no databases, no analytics platforms, and no interest in your conversations.

## How De:dobe Works

1. **Local Processing Only**
   All extraction and processing happens entirely within your browser. Your conversation data never leaves your device.

2. **No External Servers**
   De:dobe does not connect to any external servers, APIs, or cloud services. Ever.

3. **No Analytics or Tracking**
   We do not use Google Analytics, telemetry, error reporting services, or any form of usage tracking.

4. **No Third-Party Code**
   All code runs locally. No CDN scripts, no external dependencies that could phone home.

## Your Data

When you export a conversation:
- The data is generated entirely in your browser
- The file is saved directly to your local filesystem
- No copies are made, stored, or transmitted to anyone
- The extension forgets the data immediately after export

## Permissions Explained

De:dobe requests the following browser permissions:

- **`activeTab`** - Required to read the currently open LLM conversation page
- **`scripting`** - Required to inject the extraction code into the page
- **`downloads`** - Required to save the exported file to your computer
- **`storage`** - Required to remember your export preferences (AEON stub toggle)
- **`host_permissions`** - Required to access ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and Grok web pages

These permissions are used exclusively for the stated functionality. Nothing more.

## Open Source

De:dobe is fully open source. You can audit every line of code:

**GitHub Repository:** https://github.com/BlackOrchardLabs/de-dobe

If you don't trust us, read the code. That's why it's public.

## Changes to This Policy

If we ever change this privacy policy, we will:
1. Update this document in the repository
2. Increment the version number
3. Notify users via the extension update notes

We will never silently change our privacy practices.
